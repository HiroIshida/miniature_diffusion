## My sandbox of diffusion models for trajectory generation
The dataset was generated by running RRT-Connect + shortcut with different random seeds.
The goal is to train a model to learn the distribution of solution trajectories.

I thought this would be a good starting point to implement and better understand diffusion models for imitation learning, so I gave it a try.

For now, I’ve only tested an MLP model — results are not great.
Next, I plan to try Transformer and 1D U-Net architectures.


### installation
```bash
uv sync
```

### usage
```bash
uv run generate_dataset.py
uv run train.py
uv run evaluate.py --step 100  # step 0 ~ 100
```
Result (MLP):
